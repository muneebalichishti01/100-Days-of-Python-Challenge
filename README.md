* **[Specific Area 1, e.g., Python Fundamentals]**
* **[Specific Area 2, e.g., Data Structures and Algorithms]**
* **[Specific Area 3, e.g., Web Development (Frontend/Backend)]**
* **[Specific Area 4, e.g., Cloud Computing (AWS/Azure/GCP)]**
* **[Specific Area 5, e.g., DevOps and Automation]**
* **[Other Areas of Interest]**
