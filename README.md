# 14 Days of Practice - Python Basics

Welcome to my repository documenting my 14 Days of Practice journey! This is a personal commitment to revisiting Python basics, either as a refresher or for foundational learning, by working on small daily projects inspired by various ideas.

## About This Journey

The goal of this initiative is to dedicate time each day for 14 days to strengthen my understanding of Python fundamentals. Each day, I will work on a small project to practice and reinforce key concepts. This repository will serve as a log of my progress, including code examples, notes, and resources. After completing this, I plan to work on other projects or create a separate repository for intermediate and advanced topics.

## Learning Goals

For this 14-day practice, my initial focus will include:

* **Python Fundamentals**
* **Basic Data Structures (Lists, Dictionaries, etc.)**
* **Control Flow (Loops, Conditionals)**
* **Functions and Modules**
* **File Handling**
* **Error Handling**

## Daily Projects

Here are some of the projects I will be working on, inspired by the files in this repository:

1. **Day 1**: Band Name Generator - Combine user inputs to generate a fun band name.
2. **Day 2**: Tip Calculator - Calculate the cost per person, including tips.
3. **Day 3**: Treasure Hunt Game - A text-based adventure game with choices.
4. **Day 4**: Rock, Paper, Scissors - A simple game against the computer.
5. **Day 5**: Password Generator - Create secure, random passwords.
6. **Day 6**: Number Guessing Game - Guess a randomly generated number.
7. **Day 7**: Hangman Game - A word-guessing game with limited lives.
8. **Day 8**: Caesar Cipher - Encrypt and decrypt messages using a shift cipher.
9. **Day 9**: Secret Auction Program - Determine the highest bidder in an auction.
10. **Day 10**: Calculator - Perform basic arithmetic operations interactively.
11. **Day 11**: Blackjack Game - A simplified version of the card game.
12. **Day 12**: Tic-Tac-Toe - A two-player game on a 3x3 grid.
13. **Day 13**: Debugging Practices - Learn and apply debugging techniques.
14. **Day 14**: Higher or Lower Game - Compare follower counts of famous personalities.
